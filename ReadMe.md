This is a British Pattern configuration of MrDagrees ELSFiveM. This has British lightbar patterns to add a British feel to your city and to your exciting chases you have.

How to use:

1. Go into the VCF folder and copy and paste the EXAMPLE.XML and paste a new one.
2. Rename the XML file to the spawn name of the vehicle you want to add it to. (Caps sensitive) e.g bmwm5els.xml
3. Go into the vcf.lua file and make a new line, MAKE SURE THERE IS A COMMA AFTER THE LAST ONE, add speech marks and type the vehicle spawn name into it. E.G 

vcf_files = {
	"EXAMPLE.XML",
  "bmwm5els.XML",
}
